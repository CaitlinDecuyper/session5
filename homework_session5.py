# homework Session 5 - Caitlin Decuyper

# The homework exercise for this class is to use the data you collected from your experiment and to explore it, possibly clean it,
# and plot the main contrast of interest in a sensible way.
# This applies to both the picture verification task (e.g. matching vs. nonmatching) and the lexical decision task (e.g. word frequency).
